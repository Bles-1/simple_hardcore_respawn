**This mod allows you to respawn other players in Hardcore mode, at the cost of totem of undying.** 

### Description: 

_You're playing with your friend on Hardcore. You split into teams: you mined diamonds and iron, and he did the farming. You also finished a raid and got a totem. Suddenly, you see a message in the chat: "**YourFriend was poked to death by a sweet berry bush**." What should you do?_ 

_It's __simple__! With __Simple__ Hardcore Respawn_  
_Craft a Re-Spawner and use the totem to respawn your friend on Hardcore._

### Extra features:

### <span style="color:#fbeeb8">/gamerule respawnerUnbanning [true|false]</span>

Set to true if your server has a mechanic for banning players upon death. If true, respawner will unban player with given nickname.

### <span style="color:#eccafa">/gamerule respawnerCharging [true|false]</span>

Default true. This gamerule allows you to respawn players without charging, like in version 1.0. For these who don't like new charging mechanics.
